# MVC-CMS-Portfolio
I'm planning on making a new version of my portfolio. This time I will try to more complex system for my portfolio. The reason why I'm beginning from scratch is, I have learned new ways of coding and want to challenge myself to be a better programmer.

In this version I will build my own MVC and CMS system for my porftolio. I haven never build one my own so this is going to be fun.
